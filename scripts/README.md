This directory contains scripts for building and running the BankTransactApp.

## Scripts

### `build_and_run.sh` (Recommended)

```

```bash
./scripts/build_app.sh
```

```bash
./scripts/run_app.sh
```

## Quick Start

1. **From the BankTransact root directory:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_and_run.sh
   ```

2. **The app will open automatically** and you can start using it!

## Requirements

3. Try cleaning the build folder in Xcode (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
4. Run the script again
